# MtoU_LiveLink Development History

MtoU_LiveLink 0.1.0 is a completed composite Maya 2022.4 and stock Unreal
Editor 5.7.4 Live Link product.

## Timeline

- **2026-07-31:** Defined the one-character local Live Link architecture,
  protocol, Maya sampling contract, Unreal binding workflow, lifecycle, and
  performance gates.
- **2026-08-11:** Completed the Maya sender, Unreal runtime/editor modules,
  automated tests, bilingual product documentation, and independent host
  packaging.
- **2026-08-11:** Corrected shared BlendShape alias handling to match the
  established FBX/Unreal workflow, then passed stock-engine production
  acceptance with the supplied C04 rig and exported Skeletal Mesh.
- **2026-08-11:** Migrated both host components into the `composite/` category,
  verified ToolsLab external-plugin discovery, and centralized product metadata
  at the composite project root.
